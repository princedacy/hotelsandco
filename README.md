 [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project setup

## Strategy to rebuild a front-end application from scratch

###### Day 1:

* Identify the business objectives and user needs that the new application should address.
* Define the features and functionality that the application should have.
* Determine the target audience and user flows for the application.

###### Days 2-4:

*	Work with business units and the design team to gather detailed requirements for the application.
*	Conduct a technical analysis to determine the best technology stack and architecture for the application.
*	Identify any integration points with the legacy platform and gather requirements for those integrations.

###### Days 5-12:

*	Create wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface and user flows.
*	Design the application architecture and database schema.
*	Engage with the back-end team to understand their API capabilities and any limitations.

###### Days 13-30:

*	Set up the development environment and build tools.
*	Develop the application according to the design and requirements.
*	Write unit and integration tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the code.

###### Go-live:

*	Set up a staging environment for testing and QA.
*	Perform functional, performance, and security testing on the staging environment.
*	Fix any issues or bugs that are discovered during testing.
*	Deploy the application to the production environment.
